This project is designed to deepen the understanding of Abstract Data Types (ADTs) and various data structures. The primary goal is to implement an ADT using different data structures, such as ArrayRobot, FixedRobot, and Parts. Additionally, the project emphasizes the use of version control systems like Git, writing thorough documentation, following coding conventions, working with test cases, and debugging code within the Eclipse IDE.
