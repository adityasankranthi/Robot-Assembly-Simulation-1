# CompSci 351 / CompSt 751 Homework Assignment 1

This is a homework assignment at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

## Planning: Due Friday 10pm

### Focus

#### What is this homework assignment about?
This homework assignment helps get comfortable with the utilization of Abstract Data Types (ADTs), understanding various data structures and the difference between the both. The primary objective is to implement an ADT using different data structures like ArrayRobot,FixedRobot and Parts. Additionally, it focuses on utilizing version control systems like Git, writing documentation while following coding conventions, working with test cases, and debugging code within the Eclipse IDE.

### Gather

#### What do I know?  What do I need to know that's new?
I know what ADTs are, how arrays work and the syntax to implement them. I need to get myself familiar with testing and debugging code using Eclipse along with writing documentation. 

### Brainstorm

#### What are some ideas for solving this homework assignment?
understand what data structures to use inside 
2. throw exceptions to relevant functions.
3. Finish Parts class first.
4. For FixedRobot because it is of fixed size I try to do if-else conditions to add/remove relevant parts.
5. Maybe I can use part's serial number to keep track of which part was added first
6. For ArrayRobot implement similar functionality to FixedRobot but with variable number of parts.
 
### Plan

#### What will I work on first after I finish this planning part?
1. Unlock all test cases.
2. Start with the Part class, I am choosing to use an alphanumeric serial number.
3. most of the Part class's methods can be implemented in a similar style to CS251.
4. FixedRobot and ArrayRobot can be defined with simple if else clauses but find a way to better implement the methods.

*The preceding steps should be completed and committed by the
Friday 10pm deadline.*
